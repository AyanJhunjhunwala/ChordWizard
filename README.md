# ChordWizard
I noticed that none of the music apps I used to learn ever did chord detection as the data needed to train a versatile model was not availiable and not completely accurate.

I made ChordWizard to help me personally with identifying chord progressions as I play them as well as maybe someone else benefitting from it.

I used data availiable on kaggle and trained the model initally on a mixture of my own playing and publically availiable data. I used a pretty small CNN model to evaluate a few chords.

# Contributor?

I am looking for someone to help me with data collection and front end dev to make this app more user friendly, accurate and also to include other elements of MIR(Music Information Retrieval).

Enjoy!
